# Garbage-classification-week2
This project implements an image classification model to automatically detect and classify garbage into six categories: Cardboard, Glass, Metal, Paper, Plastic, and Trash. It uses EfficientNetV2B2 as a base model with transfer learning and fine-tuning to improve accuracy. The model is trained on a Kaggle dataset and deployed using Google Colab.
